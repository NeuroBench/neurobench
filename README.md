# NeuroBench Algorithm Benchmarks
A harness for running evaluations on [NeuroBench](https://neurobench.ai) algorithm benchmarks.

This framework is in a beta state and is still under active development. Currently, only pytorch-based models and frameworks are supported.

NeuroBench is a community-driven project, and we welcome further development from the community. If you are interested in developing extensions to features, programming frameworks, or metrics and tasks, please see the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation
TODO: pip install

### Development
If you clone the repo directly for development, poetry can be used to maintain a virtualenv consistent with a deployment environment. In the `algorithms_benchmarks` folder run:
```
poetry install
poetry run python neurobench/examples/gsc.py
```

## Getting started
Example benchmark scripts can be found under the `neurobench/examples` folder. 

In general, the design flow for using the framework is as follows:
	
1. Train a network using the train split from a particular dataset.
2. Wrap the network in a `NeuroBenchModel`.
3. Pass the model, evaluation split dataloader, pre-/post-processors, and a list of metrics to the `Benchmark` and `run()`.

Documentation for the framework interfaces can found in [API.md](API.md).

## Developers
NeuroBench is a collaboration between industry and academic engineers and researchers. This framework is currently maintained by [Jason Yik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonlyik/), [Noah Pacik-Nelson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noah-pacik-nelson/), and [Korneel Van den Berghe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/korneel-van-den-berghe/), and there have been technical contributions from many others. A non-exhaustive list includes Gregor Lenz, Denis Kleyko, Younes Bouhadjar, Paul Hueber, Vincent Sun, Biyan Zhou, George Vathakkattil Joseph, Douwe den Blanken, Maxime Fabre, Shenqi Wang, Anurag Kumar Mishra.
