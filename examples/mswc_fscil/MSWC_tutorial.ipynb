    "### About FSCIL (Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning new tasks from a small amount of experiences while retaining knowledge of prior tasks is a hallmark of biological intelligence and a long-standing goal of general AI. It is especially a key challenge to endow edge devices with the ability to adapt to their environments and users. This benchmark thus evaluates the capacity of a learning solution to successively incorporate new classes over multiple sessions (class-incremental), with only a handful of samples from the new classes to train with (few-shot). The FSCIL task is a recently established benchmark in the computer vision domain (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10956), but it has not yet been adapted to other data modalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The MSWC FSCIL NeuroBench Task:\n",
    "Aligning with a neuromorphic interest in temporal data modalities, this benchmark introduces a FSCIL task for streaming audio keyword classification using the large Multilingual Spoken Word Corpus (MSWC) dataset (https://mlcommons.org/datasets/multilingual-spoken-words/). The task is designed to be approached in two phases: pre-training and incremental learning:\n",
    "* First, for pre-training, a set of 100 words spanning 5 base languages (English, German, Catalan, French, Kinyarwanda) with 500 training samples each are made available to train an initial model. We provide here 2 pre-trained models, a convolutional and a recurrent spiking one, both trained with gradient descent on the train samples of the 100 base keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, for incremental learning, the model undergoes 10 successive sessions to learn words from 10 new languages (Persian, Spanish, Russian, Welsh, Italian, Basque, Polish, Esparanto, Portuguese, Dutch) in a few-shot learning scenario. Each incremental session adds 10 words of the corresponding session language with only 5 training samples available per word. Here we give a tutorial for the prototypical network solution (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175), as presented in the NeuroBench paper."
