# Contribution guidelines

As a community-driven project, we welcome further development from the community. If you are interested in developing extensions to features, programming frameworks, or metrics and tasks, please follow these steps:

1. Select or open a new [issue](https://github.com/NeuroBench/algorithms_benchmarks/issues) to discuss your idea.
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch.
3. Develop your feature.
4. Add tests and documentation. We are using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) for testing, and [Google docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for documentation.
5. Open a pull request to merge your branch into the main repository.

Please feel free to reach out to the maintainers with questions about contributing!
