Non-human Primate (NHP) Motor Prediction Benchmark
=======================================================================
The NHP motor prediction task tests a model's ability to predict the movement of a primate's reach from motor cortical spike signals.
More information is available in the Primate_Reaching_tutorial notebook and associated benchmark scripts.
The task script and infrastructure were built by Paul Hueber, Vincent Sun, and Biyan Zhou.
