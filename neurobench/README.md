# Object Detection with Spiking Neural Networks on Automotive Event Data

This repository is based on the codes for the paper [Object Detection with Spiking Neural Networks on Automotive Event Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04339), accepted to the IJCNN 2022, presenting the first SNNs capable of doing object detection on the complex [Prophesee GEN1 event dataset](https://www.prophesee.ai/2020/01/24/prophesee-gen1-automotive-detection-dataset/).


## Task list

- [x] Convert the code for Prophesee gen 2 mini dataset.
- [ ] Training and validation source code for reproducing Prophesee's RED network results (ongoing with some bug -fixing).
- [ ] Train with full dataset 
- [ ] Integrate [snnmetrics](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/snnmetrics) for SNN benchmark. (Ongoing)
- [ ] Clean code and marge with the main codes
